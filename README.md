- Design Patterns:
	- For solving the architecture problem we use software patterns
	- The aim is to persent solution for decupling objects or modules and reducing the overall complexity of your architecture

- Design pattern category:
	- Creational :
		- workes with the creation of object instance in our application 
	- Structural
		- workes with the way objects are composed or put together
	- Behavioral
		- workes with the object interact with one another 
		
		
- Creational:
	- Abstract Factory
	- Builder
	- Factory Method  -- imp
	- Prototype
	- Singleton    -- most imp

- Structure:
	- Adapter 
	- Bridge
	- Composite
	- Decorator
	- Facade
	- Flyweight
	- Proxy

- Behavioral:
	- Chain of Responsibility
	- Command
	- Interpreter
	- iterator  -- imp [mostly use]
	- Mediator
	- memento
	- Observer
	- State
	- Strategy  -- imp
	- Template Method
	- Visitor
