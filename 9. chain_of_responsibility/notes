- The Gang of Four describe the proxy pattern as:
        - "avoid coupling the sender of a request and its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it. "

- PROS:
        - You can control the order of request handing.
        - You can decouple classes that invoe operations from classes that perform operations.
        - You can introduce new handlers into the app without breaking the existing client code.

- CONS:
        - Some requests may endup unhandled.

- WHEN:
        - When Your program is expected to process different kinds of requests in verious ways, but the exact types of requests and their sequences are unknown beforehand.
        - Use the pattern when it's essential to execute several handlers in a particular order.
        - Use the CoR pattern when the set of handlers and their order are supposed to change at runtime.
